# comments begin with pound, blank lines are skipped.

# each line contains either a filename or a directory name.
# must be the full path relative to the path provided as command line argument, including
# the directory specified on command line.
#
# this ignore file does not need to be in the ruby-run-resize.rb directory, you can keep it
# in your project or jekyll source directory.  then invoke the script from that directory
# and it will find the file.  alternatively, put the file whereever you want and specify the -i option
# with the full path to the ignore file
#
# ex: if executing the script to process the 'img-data' directory, and want to ignore 'ignore-me.jpg'...
#
# command line:
# 	run-ruby-resize.rb img-data
# ignore.txt:
#	img-data/ignore-me.jpg
#
#

img-data/ignore-me.jpg
img-data/ignoreDir
